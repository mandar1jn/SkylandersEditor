# SkylandersEditor

## What is this?
This is my work in progress skylanders editor. This accompanies my research into the skylanders figures and the portals, which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@marijnkneppers/list/dissecting-the-skylanders-portal-c4bd580dae2f)

## Cloning this repository
This project contains submodules and because of that an extra addition to the clone command is required. To clone this repository, use ``git clone https://github.com/mandar1jn/SkylandersEditor --recursive``.  

If you cloned this repository using the regular command, don't worry. Open a command prompt inside the root directory of the project and run ``git submodule update --init``. This should clone all submodules.

## Building 
This project uses premake 5 to generate it's project files. To generate the project files, open a command prompt inside the premake directory and run ``premake5.exe [action]`` where action is an available action from the list that can be found [here](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake).

After that, you should be familiar with whatever platform you are using and you should know how to build to project.

## Support

Although I own quite a lot of figures, I don't own any from Skylanders Imaginators and Swap Force. There are a lot of kind people I have been in contact with who are willing to help me, but it's still likely that I will, at some point in the future, need to buy a few figures to do research on. If you want to help and financially support this project, you can do that using the button below or using the direct link under the "Sponsor this project" heading somewhere on the meain repository page [here](https://github.com/mandar1jn/SkylandersEditor)
